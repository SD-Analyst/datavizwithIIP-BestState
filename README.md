# datavizwithIIP-BestState
My first assignment submission for the Week 1 challenge.
This is my very first project in regards of data collection, analysis and finally visualizing it.
For this assignment I collected primary data via google form.
It was relatively a very small dataset, but I made do with what I got in the span of 3 days.
I am fairly new to this data and coding world, looking forward to constructive feedbacks.

Just a small experiment from my end to observe any trends relating to perception of data. Here are the fun findings:
